Formarly in 2016 MyHumanKit organize an Hackaton called Fabrikarium with Airbus industries. During the Fabrikarium some test where made to hack a 3d printer to 
embosse braille on `160g paper sheet <https://myhumankit.org/actualite/fabrikarium-2016-au-croisement-des-mondes/>`_,
the project was called `BrailleRap <https://github.com/arthursw/BrailleRap/blob/master/Documentation/documentation-en.md>`_.


We thougt on the BrailleRap-SP team that it was a proof a concept and that we need some custom hardware to emboss braille easyly than with hacked 3D printer

OpenBraille

In 2017 Carlos Campos start the project OpenBraille and build a braille embosser base on recycled printers parts, the project demonstrate that we can move the 
paper sheet in the machine.

BrailleRap-SP

of embossed paper and everyone was enthousiast, BrailleRAP-SP was born.
