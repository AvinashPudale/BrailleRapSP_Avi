Assembling guide
================

Machine the embossing "stylus"
----------------------------
The embossing tool is made of an M3 screw, machined with a dremel like tool. the tip of the tool need to be smooth (avoid sharp tip that will tear the embossed material)

Assemble the embossing tool
---------------------------
#. Screw the brace on the electro-magnet axle. 
#. Screw embossing "stylus" in the brace.
#. lock the sylus with a counter lock nut.


Prepare top paper roll drive
------------------------------
We use epoxy glue to stick the sand paper on abs printed parts. Epoxy don't stick on ABS so we prepare the parts with light sanding and cyanoacrilat glue. Be careful with cyanoacrilat glue, don't stick your finger.
 
#. Print 3 paper roll **link to stl**.
#. Laser cut some piece of 180 sand paper.
#. Tap the screw hole with an M3 tap.

Prepare bottom paper roll drive
-------------------------------

#. Print 3 paper roll **link to stl**.
#. Tap the screw hole with an m3 tap.
#. Put an O-ring on the roll throat.


Laser cut the box
-----------------
Material
You will need 3 sheets of plywood 5mm thick , 600 mm x 400mm.


Use the dxf files in https://github.com/BrailleRapSP/BrailleRapSP/tree/master/lasercut to lasercut the 3 sheets.



Assemble the box
-------------------
Start to glue the 4 sides of the box with wood glue, then glue the bottom. Assemble the 4 sides and the bottom, sticking them together with blue tape.
When the glue is dry (the time depending of the glue you have used), Start assembling the Y axis.
