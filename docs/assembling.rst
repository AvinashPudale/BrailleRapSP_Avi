Assembling guide
================

Building the embossing "stylus"
-------------------------------
The embossing tool is made of an M3 screw, machined with a dremel like tool. the tip of the tool need to be smooth (avoid sharp tip that will tear the embossed material)

Assemble the embossing tool
---------------------------

#. Screw the brace on the electro-magnet axle. 
#. Screw embossing "stylus" in the brace.
#. lock the sylus with a counter lock nut.


Preparing paper roll drive
--------------------------

We use epoxy glue to stick the sand paper on abs printed parts. Epoxy don't stick on ABS so we prepare the parts with light sanding and cyanoacrilat glue.
 
#. Print **x** paper roll **link to stl**.
#. sanding printed roll with sand Paper NÂ°4 to scratch the printed surface where you want to stick sand paper.
#. "Paint" the printed parts with cyanoacrilat glue, let it dry.
#. Glue a piece of 180 sand paper on the part with bi-composant epoxy glue.
#. Let the roll dry for abu 25h depending of the epoxy glue you've used (we used standard epoxy and let the roll dry for about 24 hours)
 
Laser cut the box
-----------------

Material
You will need 3 sheets of plywood 5mm thick , 600 mm x 400mm.


Use the dxf files in https://github.com/BrailleRapSP/BrailleRapSP/tree/master/lasercut to lasercut the 3 sheets.



Assembling the box
-------------------
Start to glue the 4 sides of the box with wood glue, then glue the bottom. Assemble the 4 sides and the bottom, sticking them together with blue tape.
When the glue is dry (the time depending of the glue you have used), Start assembling the Y axis.
